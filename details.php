                <h2>Facts about Tarot</h2>
                <p>Tarot cards can help one to receive important messages and perceive their current situations in a different light. Each card represents a different lesson or situation. When shuffling the cards, you can shuffle the seventy eight cards in whatever way you would like. What matters while shuffling is putting your intentions for the session into the cards. There are five different groupings of cards. The major arcana, the wands, the cups, the swords, the pentacles. The major arcana contains a large number of cards that are all different, where the other four suits are similar to playing cards with numbers, and then a page, knight, queen, and king. Each card has an individual meaning, however it is up to the interpretation of the person doing your reading. The major arcana is meant to represent long term feelings and situations, while the other suits can be just as influential in the short term. There are three meanings behind most cards, the upright meaning, the reversed meaning, and the advice position. Keep scrolling to see what some of the cards mean. <cite>https://www.tarot.com/tarot/cards</cite></p>
