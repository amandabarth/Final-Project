        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Hi I am Lindsey. I have been reading tarot for 4 years and I am a generational tarot reader. My great great Aunt learned how to read cards from a witch doctor in Africa while living there. Her spiritual knowledge and tarot techniques have been passed down through women in my extended family. I use techniques that she used in her process and incorporate my own style that I have created through years of practice. In readings, I help people better understand their subconscious and thoughts, make decisions in their lives, and learn about their probable paths in the future. I most often work with clients who are searching for their next move in their career, love life, or mental health journeys. I usually provide a thirty-minute session which includes a general reading, questions from clients, and a final spread encompassing their past, present, and future. I usually provide individual sessions but also work with couples, friends, and parties.I strive to help people make decisions in their lives that will have positive outcomes on their life and energy, become more aware of their subconscious, and feel comfortable and confident with their futures.
